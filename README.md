## Setup
For the basic setup of our project we came up with our initial idea which was to create a store that had the ability to log in to view the store. From there we talked a lot on Zoom and slack to come up with all the tasks needed to complete the MVP and any other added features we would want. Another huge help was creating a Trello Board that was used to create our user stories and ultimately decide which features we would like to add.

## Challenges
The first big challenge we ran into was how to structure the work load between everyone to ensure that we wouldn't all be working in the same files and creating merge conflicts with one another. Once we began getting the hang of Trello and assigning tasks it all fell into place and we began working without much challenge. Other than a few merge conflicts that were easily resolved we didn't have any problems working as a team.

## Added Features
The first added feature which was also part of the MVP was the ability to sign up and log in to our site which would then allow the user to view the store. We wanted to base all of our features around the log in. After the log in ability was created, Keith engineered the ability to have a chat box which would allow all the users currently logged in to actually chat with each other in real time. As a final added feature we have an easter egg hidden within that chat box.

## Technology Used
As the project states, this was made using the MEAN stack (Mongoose, Express, Angular and Node). We created all of our controllers and models and the basic server setup on the first day. From there we wanted to try and use the partials that we had just covered as much as we could. We did our best to keep the index.html clean of any hard coding and instead used partials in place of most of the hard coding. Keith also created a system for the login so that only certain characters are used, there are minimum and maximum character lengths and also added extra security for those logins. Jon did a fantastic job at styling a good bit of the site and added a little humor to it as well.
